					<h1>Drake signs with the Jordan Brand</h1>
					<p>Now that Kanye West has officially severed his ties with Nike, Drake has stepped up to design for the brand.
					The rapper announced the deal last night at his concert in Portland, according to Billboard. "Today also happens to be one of the best days of my life," he said. "You know, growing up, I'm sure we all idolized this guy he goes by the name of Michael Jordan. So today, I came to Portland, Oregon and I officially became inducted into the Team Jordan family."
					Michael Jordan's Twitter account also heralded the partnership earlier today. "He's home," wrote Jordan. "Welcome the newest member of #TeamJordan, Drake." Drake posted images of some of his designs OVO Stingray 10s and OVO Stingray 12s to his Instagram page.
					Previously, Drake has made forays into the fashion world as a consultant with the NBA team the Toronto Raptors. In September, he revealed that part of that deal would be launching a clothing line for the team. Two years ago, he put out a limited run of varsity jackets via his October's Very Own line. And in between those two ventures, he found himself criticizing clothing lines launched without his consent by Walgreens and Macy's for emblazoning clothing with the slogan "YOLO." "Walgreens. . . you gotta either chill or cut the cheque," he said at the time. "Macy's. . . same goes for you."
					</p>

					<p>The question posed in the headline doesn't have a simple answer, but it still needs to be asked. For the past week, and especially yesterday when the Kanye West x adidas partnership was officially confirmed, the Three Stripes owned the sneaker conversation. At 11:22 a.m. yesterday, adidas welcomed "one of the most influential cultural icons of this generation, Kanye West." It was as close to second fiddle as Nike has found itself in some time.</p>

					<p>Then, just over nine hours later, Drake started teasing off-white OVO Jordans on his Instagram. And today, just five days after West shook things up by flaming on Sway's Shade 45 radio show that Jordans are only popular because he and his manager Don C wear them, Jordan Brand announced that they have signed Drake. It was a perfect chess move for Jordan, countering Kanye's attack on the name that the Jordan Brand carries; it was also a brilliant tactical move for Drake, who over the past 12 months has established himself as West's main competition. This isn't as much about the deals, which could be enormously different in scope, as it is about the personalities. Sign, counter-sign.</p>
